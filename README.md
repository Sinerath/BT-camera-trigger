This is an arduino code that can be used with any bluetooth capable arduino like ESP32 to act as a remote operated camera shutter with external switches etc.

By default setup for a Normally CLOSED switch to be connected between SWITCH_PIN and GND

By default setup to send a KEY_MEDIA_VOLUME_UP keyboard press

the code prevents sending another keypress untill the switch is released and pressed again

Originally created for 3D printer timelapses as on some printers a simple cable trigger can take multiple photos when printer is purgin and / or the cable can be in the way
